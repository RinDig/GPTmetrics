# Configuration for CCR analysis module (can be expanded)
# Currently, most CCR specific configs are in the main app_config.py
# This file is a placeholder for more specific CCR settings if needed.

# Example: if ccr_wrapper had more specific tunable parameters not suitable for global app_config
# CCR_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.5 
# CCR_EMBEDDING_MODEL_VARIANT = 'paraphrase-MiniLM-L3-v2' # If different from main SBERT model
