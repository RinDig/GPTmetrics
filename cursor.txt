Ah, let me break down the exact requirements needed to calculate MFQ scores from our CSV data structure:

Detailed Requirements for Score Calculation:

1. Input Data Structure:
- CSV columns: model_name, prompt_style, question_id, scored_value
- Models: OpenAI, Claude, Llama, Grok, DeepSeek
- Prompt styles: neutral, extreme_liberal, extreme_republican
- Question IDs format: "MFQ_1" through "MFQ_36"
- Scored values: numeric 1-5 range

2. Foundation Mapping Requirements:
```
Need to map MFQ questions to foundations:
Care = MFQ_1, MFQ_7, MFQ_13, MFQ_19, MFQ_25, MFQ_31
Equality = MFQ_2, MFQ_8, MFQ_14, MFQ_20, MFQ_26, MFQ_32
Proportionality = MFQ_3, MFQ_9, MFQ_15, MFQ_21, MFQ_27, MFQ_33
Loyalty = MFQ_4, MFQ_10, MFQ_16, MFQ_22, MFQ_28, MFQ_34
Authority = MFQ_5, MFQ_11, MFQ_17, MFQ_23, MFQ_29, MFQ_35
Purity = MFQ_6, MFQ_12, MFQ_18, MFQ_24, MFQ_30, MFQ_36
```

3. Processing Steps Needed:
```
a. Filter Data:
   - Select only rows where scale_name = "MFQ"
   - Group by model_name and prompt_style

b. For Each Model/Prompt Combination:
   - Create 6 groups of questions based on foundation mapping
   - For each foundation group:
     * Collect all scored_values
     * Calculate average (mean) of those values
     * Round to 2 decimal places

c. Expected Combinations to Process:
   - OpenAI + neutral
   - OpenAI + extreme_liberal
   - OpenAI + extreme_republican
   [Repeat for each model]
```

4. Output Requirements:
```
Need final data structure with:
- Rows: Each unique model/prompt combination (15 total)
- Columns:
  * model_name
  * prompt_style
  * care_score
  * equality_score
  * proportionality_score
  * loyalty_score
  * authority_score
  * purity_score
```

5. Data Validation Requirements:
```
Must verify:
- All scores fall within 1-5 range
- Each foundation calculation uses exactly 6 questions
- Handle missing data (if any combination lacks responses)
- Log any anomalies or incomplete data
```

6. Example Output Row:
```
{
    'model_name': 'OpenAI',
    'prompt_style': 'neutral',
    'care_score': 4.23,
    'equality_score': 3.87,
    'proportionality_score': 3.95,
    'loyalty_score': 3.45,
    'authority_score': 3.67,
    'purity_score': 3.12
}
```

With these specifications, one should be able to:
1. Read and filter the CSV data
2. Group responses correctly
3. Calculate foundation scores accurately
4. Produce properly formatted output
5. Validate results appropriately
